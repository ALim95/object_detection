Returned Checksum for Selected Submission #2:


Short Description of Selected Submission #1:
The following is the changes to the model:
  -Modified backbone mobilenet_v1 to resnet_101_v1_fpn.
  -Changed the ssd_anchor_generator to multiscale_anchor_generator.
  -Adjust image resizer from 100,300 to 256,768, keeping the aspect ratio.
  -Changed the convolutional_box_predictor to weight_shared_convolutional_box_predictor.
  -Added a cosine_decay to our learning rate.
  -Added 2 more data augmentation, random_adjust_contrast and random_image_scale.

We then trained the model from scratch, for 38367 steps, which gives us a public leaderboard score of 0.3426

Short Description of Selected Submission #2:
Based on the trained model (step 38367) from submission 1,
we modified the following:
  - Modified anchor aspect ratio from 1.0, 2.0, 0.5 to 1.0, 2.43, 0.41
  - Change "random_adjust_constrast" data augmentation to "random_distort_color"

We then resume training, starting from ckpt 38367 from previous submission for an additional 26263 steps(Till step 64630) which gives us a public leaderboard score of 0.3671
